                Hi there! I'm Alisa — a high school sophomore who's passionate about building interactive web experiences. I love combining code and art to create digital spaces that are both functional and visually engaging.

                Whether it's 3D design, digital art, or immersive interfaces, I'm always exploring new ways to be creative on the web. When I'm not coding, you can find me experimenting with new design tools or hunting for inspiration in the world around me. :)

                This website in particular was made for Day 12 of Hack Club's Haxmas. I've had a lot of fun experimenting with new libraries and digital tools, and I especially enjoyed working with Three.js and WebGL for this project. I look forward to implementing these tools in future projects of mine, as I enjoy creating 3D art.
